Tensorflow experiments

### Requirements
If you are running Mac OS < 10.11, tensorflow must be installed manually from wheels hosted by Google:

`pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.1-py2-none-any.whl`

When importing tensorflow, you may get an error along the lines of `"Versioning for this project requires either an
sdist tarball, or access to an upstream git repository. Are you sure that git is installed?"` See here for details:
